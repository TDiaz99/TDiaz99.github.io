This video provides a basic introduction to navigating SituationAnalyst.

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:15.199
When you open Situation Analyst you will see the map; the zoom in, zoom out, and current location buttons; and the navigation menu.

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:24.799
Within the navigation menu is the Briefing mode, the Manage Layers menu, the Edit menu, and the Tools menu;

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.300
the Help button, the Map legend, and the Workspaces menu.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.333
In the main display, you can hold and drag to move around the map.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:41.099
On PCs you can zoom in by using your scroll wheel

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.233
or by holding shift while clicking and dragging over the area you want to zoom in on.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.900
On touch devices, you can zoom by pinching in or out.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:01:00.766
On all devices, you can use the plus or minus buttons to zoom in or out, as well as the location button to go to your current location.

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:07.299
Selecting a location on the map will open an info panel with details about the selected location.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.333
Selecting Navigation will open directions in your deviceâ€™s default map application.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:22.599
The Briefing Mode provides information about active incidents, committed resources, and response activities.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.000
The Manage Layers menu allows users to select and customize visible layers on the map.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.732
You can change the basemap, as well as the basemap opacity.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.366
You can turn on or off individual layers on the map by selecting the layer name.

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:42.932
You will know a layer is on when there is a blue bar to the left of the layer name.

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:48.466
With the search bar, you can search for specific layers as well as locations.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:53.966

00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:01.166
The Edit menu allows users to add layers into SituationAnalyst.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:06.499
Any layers added will be removed when you change workspaces or when the webpage is refreshed.

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:11.932
The Tools menu provides a different set of tools based on the open Workspace.

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:17.166
More information on Workspace-specific tools can be found in the user guide.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:23.899
In all workspaces, the Tools menu allows for measuring distances or lengths and searching within layers.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.133
This is different from the Manage Layers menu search bar, which searches for the layers themselves and not for items within the layer.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.666
The Workspaces menu allows you to switch between workspaces.

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:38.566

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:33.799
Applications that you are not able to access will appear greyed out.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.733
The Lightning Viewer application is different than the Lightning workspace.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.100
The legend shows the symbols on the map and what they represent.

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:49.633
